# Local-Alarm-for-Eve-Online
Personal project made for the game Eve Online where it takes a screenshot and checks it against enemy icons, in which case it will play a sound.

How to use the program:
After downloading, unzipping and using the provided .exe:
1)Click "Chatbox Position Helper"
2)Move the newly popped up window over your chat, resize it to be slightly bigger than the chatbox. Alternatively place it anywhere you want the program to detect the neutral/enemy symbols. The larger the area the slower it will run.
3)Once position is set, click "Pick location" and close the window.
4)Close the first window. It is now running in the background.

If you've already launched the program and have set up a position for your chat before, simply press "Load from file" and it will load the last position you've set up, after which you can close the window and it will be running in the background.
To stop the program, close the command prompt-like window.
